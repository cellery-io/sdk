|list| This allows to list instances/images | <ul> <li>`instances`: List of instances running on the current cellery system </li><li>`images`: List the images available in the local cellery repository</li> <li>`ingresses` or `components`: List of ingresses/components available in a cell instance or image. <ul><li>Cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system</li><li>Cell image name: Name of the cell image. The cell could remain within local cellery repository or it is in the remote docker hub.</li></ul></li></ul> | `cellery list instaces` <br/> `cellery list images` <br/> `cellery list ingress my-cell-inst` <br/> `cellery list ingress wso2/my-cell:1.0.0` <br/> `cellery list components my-cell-inst` <br/> `cellery list components wso2/my-cell:1.0.0`|
|login | This login the user to the docker hub, and caches the credentials in the key ring in their machine, therefore user doesn't need to repeat typing the credentials | None | `cellery login`|
|push | This command will push the cell image to the docker hub user account | <ul> <li> Cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format `<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<VERSION>`</li></ul> | `cellery push wso2/my-cell:1.0.0`
|pull | This command will pull the cell image from docker registry and include in the cellery local repository | <ul> <li> Cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format `<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<VERSION>`</li></ul> | `cellery pull wso2/my-cell:1.0.0`|
|terminate | This will terminate the running cell instance within cell runtime |<ul><li>Cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system</li></ul> | `cellery terminate my-cell-inst`|
|status | This will check for the runtime status of the cell instance  | <ul><li>Cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system</li></ul> | `cellery status my-cell-inst`|
|logs | This will fetch logs of all components or specific component within the cell instance and print in the console | <ul><li>Cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system</li><li>`c`: Name of the component of which the logs are required</li></ul> | `cellery logs my-cell-inst` <br/> `cellery logs my-cell-inst -c my-comp`|
|inspect | This will list the files of a cell image | <ul> <li> Cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format `<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:<VERSION>`</li></ul> | `cellery inspect wso2/my-cell:1.0.0`|
|extract-resources | This will extract the resources folder of the cell image. This is useful to see the swagger definitions of the cell APIs therefore users can generate client code to invoke the cell APIs | <ul> <li> `o`: Output location of extracted resources`</li></ul>| `cellery extract-resources wso2/my-cell:1.0.0` <br/> `cellery extract-resources wso2/my-cell:1.0.0 -o /my/output/resource`|
