#### Cellery Setup
Cellery setup command install and manage cellery runtimes. For this purpose it supports several sub commands. Please 
refer the [setup command readme](cli-setup-command.md) for complete instructions.

##### Cellery setup status:

The project name also can be provided as inline param which will initialize the cellery project as given.

Ex:

 ```
    cellery init

#### Cellery Build

Build an immutable cell image.

###### Parameters:

    cellery run wso2/my-cell:1.0.0 -y
 ```

#### Cellery List

List running instances/cell images. This command can take four forms, for listing components, images, ingresses or instances.

##### Cellery List Components:

List the components which the cell image/instance encapsulate.

###### Parameters: 

* _cell instance name/cell image name: Either the cell instance name and cell image name._

Ex:
 ```
   cellery list components my-cell-inst
   cellery list components cellery-samples/employee:1.0.0
 ```
 
##### Cellery List Images

Lists the available cell images.

Ex:
 ```
   cellery list images
 ```

##### Cellery List Ingresses

List the exposed APIs of a cell image/instance.

###### Parameters: 

* _cell instance name/cell image name: Either the cell instance name and cell image name._

Ex: 
 ```
   cellery list ingresses my-cell-inst
   cellery list ingresses cellery-samples/employee:1.0.0
 ```

###### Cellery List Instances

List all running cells.

Ex:

 ```
    cellery list instances 
 ```

[Back to Command List](#cellery-cli-commands)

#### Cellery delete

Delete cell images. This command will delete one or more cell images from cellery local repository. Users can also delete all cell images by executing the command with "--all" flag.

##### Parameters:

* _cell image names: This is a space separated list of existing cell images and/or regular expression of cell images._

Ex:
 ```
   cellery delete cellery-samples/employee:1.0.0 cellery-samples/hr:1.0.0
   cellery delete --regex 'cellery-samples/.*:1.0.0'
   cellery delete cellery-samples/employee:1.0.0 --regex '.*/employee:.*'
   cellery delete --all
 ```

 [Back to Command List](#cellery-cli-commands)

#### Cellery login

Log in the user to the cellery image repository, which is docker hub, and caches the credentials in the key ring in their machine, therefore user doesn't need to repeat typing the credentials.

Ex: 

 ```
    cellery login
 ```

[Back to Command List](#cellery-cli-commands)

#### Cellery Push

Push the cell image to the docker hub user account.

###### Parameters:

* _cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format <ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:\<VERSION>_

Ex:

 ```
    cellery push wso2/my-cell:1.0.0
 ```

#### Cellery Pull

Pull the cell image from docker registry and include in the cellery local repository.

###### Parameters:

* _cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format <ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:\<VERSION>_

Ex: 
 ```
   cellery pull wso2/my-cell:1.0.0
 ```

#### Cellery Terminate

Terminate the running cell instance within cell runtime.

###### Parameters:

* _cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system_

Ex: 
 ```
   cellery terminate my-cell-inst
 ```

#### Cellery Status

Check for the runtime status of the cell instance.

###### Parameters:

* _cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system_

Ex: 
 ```
   cellery status my-cell-inst
 ```

#### Cellery Logs

Fetch logs of all components or specific component within the cell instance and print in the console.

###### Parameters:

* _cell instance name: Name of the instance running in the cellery system_

###### Flags (Optional):

* _-c, --component: Name of the component of which the logs are required_

Ex: 
 ```
   cellery logs my-cell-inst 
   cellery logs my-cell-inst -c my-comp
 ```

#### Cellery Inspect

List the files included in a cell image.

###### Parameters:

* _cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format <ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:\<VERSION>_

Ex:
 ```
   cellery inspect wso2/my-cell:1.0.0
 ```

#### Cellery Extract Resources

This will extract the resources folder of the cell image. This is useful to see the swagger definitions of the cell APIs therefore users can generate client code to invoke the cell APIs.

###### Parameters:

* _cell image name: This is the image name, and it should be in format <ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<IMAGE_NAME>:\<VERSION>_

###### Flags (Optional):

* _-o, --output: The directory into which the resources should be extracted_
